#  Handwritten Digit Recognition with Python and Keras

## Description:
Explore the world of deep learning with this Python project that uses Keras to implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for handwritten digit recognition. The model is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits (0 through 9). Dive into the code to understand the implementation details and experiment with different parameters for optimal performance.

## Key Features:
Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Implemented using Keras for effective pattern recognition.
MNIST Dataset: 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images for diverse handwriting styles.
Python Implementation: Code simplicity and readability for accessibility to developers of all levels.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for training and evaluation.
